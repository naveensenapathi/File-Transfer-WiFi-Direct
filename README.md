WiFi Direct File Transfer works with good performances.<br/>
The primary limitations are the "Discovery Phase" of this protocol and the Wi-Fi Direct's implementation in Android:<br/>
1. The discovery time is proportional to the number of devices <br/>
2. After a certain time, when a device is no longer discoverable, you may need to restart the Discovery Phase on all devices <br/>

## Features

1. Shows a list of nearby devices<br/>
2. Manage connection/disconnection between devices<br/>
3. Send multiple files between two devices<br/>
4. View device information without disconnection<br/>
5. Auto restart servers to receive files and device information.

<br/>
