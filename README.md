# WiFi-Direct-File-Transfer-App
WiFi Direct File Transfer is a experimental app that will allow sharing of data between Android devices running Android 4.0 or higher using a WiFi direct connection without the use of a WiFi access point. This will enable data transfer between devices without relying on any existing network infrastructure

WiFi Direct File Transfer works with good performances.<br/>
The main problems are the "Discovery Phase" of this protocol and the Wi-Fi Direct's implementation in Android, in fact:<br/>
1. The discovery time is too high when the number of devices increases <br/>
2. After a certain time, a device is no longer discoverable from others, so you need to restart the Discovery Phase on all devices <br/>

This shows that it's possible to extend the Wi-Fi Direct protocol in Android in some particular and limited scenarios, for example a transfer files.
